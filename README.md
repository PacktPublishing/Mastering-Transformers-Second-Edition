**The journey from BERT to large language models and stable diffusion**

## What is this book about?

Transformer-based language models have dominated natural language processing studies and become a new paradigm. With this NLP transformers book, youâ€™ll be able to implement multimodal solutions, including text-to-image (Stable Diffusion).

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Focus on solving simple-to-complex NLP problems with Python
* Discover how to solve classification/regression problems with traditional NLP approaches
* Train a language model and explore how to fine-tune models to the downstream tasks
* Understand how to use transformers for generative AI and computer vision tasks
* Build transformer-based NLP apps with the Python transformers library
* Focus on language generation such as machine translation and conversational AI in any language
* Speed up transformer model inference to reduce latency

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification",
    model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
sequence_to_classify = "I am going to france."
candidate_labels = ['travel', 'cooking', 'dancing']
classifier(sequence_to_classify, candidate_labels)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

Complete with step-by-step explanation and exploration of Stable Diffusion model with Python, you will start to understand how Stable Diffusion works and how the source code is organized to make your own advanced features, or even build one of your own complete standalone Stable Diffusion application.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-18).
